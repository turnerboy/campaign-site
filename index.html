      <h3>My Statement</h3>
      <p>
        Dear Members of the Senate,<br><br>
        I am writing to express my strong interest in serving on the Senate at McMaster University. 
        As an engineering design graduate student, my academic background and practical experiences 
        have prepared me to contribute meaningfully to the Senate’s responsibilities, particularly 
        in promoting educational resources and academic events that enrich the student experience.<br><br>

        During my time at McMaster, I have embraced the principles of design thinking, working closely 
        with organizations such as St. Joseph’s, the City of Hamilton, the Hamilton Street Railway, 
        CityLAB Hamilton, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. These collaborations have honed my ability 
        to identify challenges, propose innovative solutions, and engage diverse stakeholders. I 
        believe these skills will be invaluable in supporting the Senate’s mandate to foster academic 
        excellence and transparent communication within the university community.<br><br>

        Living close to campus has afforded me the opportunity to attend various academic events 
        regularly. However, I have observed that attendance is often low, and many students miss out 
        on the benefits of educational events and academic lectures. I am committed to ensuring that 
        every student, regardless of their proximity to McMaster’s campus, can benefit from these 
        opportunities. My goal is to increase the transparency of these events, improve access, and 
        encourage greater participation among all students so that everyone can share the same valuable 
        experience.<br><br>

        Having thoroughly reviewed the McMaster University Act of 1976, I am prepared to uphold its 
        responsibilities and contribute my user-centred design perspective to enhance academic engagement. 
        I am eager to leverage my expertise, dedication, and advocacy to support the Senate’s goals and 
        improve the overall student experience.<br><br>

        I am excited to contribute actively and make a positive impact with the members of the Senate. 
        Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to the opportunity to serve.<br><br>

        Sincerely,<br>
        Sriganesh Kaniarasu
